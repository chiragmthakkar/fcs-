In this problem of Tower Of Hanoi(TOH), we use the method of recursion.
The base condition is when there is only one disk in the pole.
In the function solve, we pass the number of disks, the source, the destination and the auxillary poles.
Assume that the number of discs is 3. Since the number of disks is more than one, the else part will be excecuted. We will now shift (noDisk-1) all the disks except the last disk, to the auxillary pole as the destination and using the destination pole as the auxillary.
So, for (noDisk-1), ie. 2 disks,we call the solve function. Since this is a recursive function, the solve function will be called with noDisk = 2. Since there are two disks, the base condition will not be executed. The else part will be now excecuted, with calling the solve function again with noDisk-1 , ie. (2-1) 1 disk. Since this is a recursive function the solve function will be called, but this time the number of disks is 1, and hence the base condition will be executed.

Thus, in this manner, by using recursion, we divide a big problem into small sub parts till a base condition is satisfied. And by solving small sub parts, we solve the entire problem with the help of recursion.
