Dear manager, 

The problem (1), was due to no implemention code at Insertion Sort.java, I fixed sort the String according to the names and have to return index;  

The problem (2), was due to no sort function in the search function in Company.java. It was searching a normal array not a sorted array, I fixed it by calling the sort function sortStaffByAge() and then performed the searching.

The problem (3), was due to <your explanation>, I fixed doing <your explanation>;

Kind regards,
Chirag
